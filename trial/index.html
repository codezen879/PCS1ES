                Roman Reigns (born May 25, 1985, Pensacola, Florida, U.S.) American professional wrestler, athlete, and actor. He is best known for holding multiple
                championships in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)as one of the company’s most notable stars. Born into a renowned American Samoan wrestling family
                Anoa‘i was surrounded by ring legends. His father, Sika, was one half of the Wild Samoans tag team, and he counted among his extended family a number

                of wrestling greats and WWE stars such as Rikishi (Solofa Fatu, Jr.), Yokozuna (Rodney Anoa‘i), and, perhaps the most famous member of the Anoa‘i dynasty,
                Dwayne (“The Rock”)  Johnson.However, despite growing up in a family of grapplers, his first athletic endeavours were in American football. After playing
                in high school, Anoa‘i played college football as a defensive tackle for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. He was undrafted in the 2007 NFL draft and was 
                later signed and subsequently released by both the Minnesota Vikings and the Jacksonville Jaguars without having played in any regular season games. 
                He eventually landed in the Canadian Football League as a member of the Edmonton Eskimos (now the Edmonton Elks) but was released by that team in 2008.
